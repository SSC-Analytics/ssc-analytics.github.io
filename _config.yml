# This config file is meant for settings that affect the entire site, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are essentially global variables that can be accessed by {{site.title}},
